## What We Actually Build

**Real Estate Platforms**  
Property websites that don’t just showcase listings—they automate lead capture, integrate with existing CRMs, and turn visitors into qualified prospects through smart routing.

**Legal Technology**  
Document collaboration that works like Google Docs but built for legal workflows. Real-time editing, version control, and sync that doesn’t break when the internet hiccups.

**E-commerce That Converts**  
Shopify themes optimized for international markets. Multi-language support that actually works, performance that passes Core Web Vitals, and checkout flows that don’t hemorrhage customers.

**Business Systems**  
Construction platforms with project tracking, content systems that scale, and PWAs that work offline. We build for businesses that need systems, not just websites.

**Full-stack APIs**  
Django backends with proper authentication, TypeScript contracts between frontend and backend, and database design that scales beyond the MVP phase.

## Our Philosophy

At **Other Dev**, we don’t just ship pages—we ship systems that scale. Whether it’s real-time collaboration that syncs across devices, e-commerce that converts international traffic, or property platforms that automate chaos into qualified leads.

We cut the fluff, automate what should be automated, and deliver experiences that serve the business first, browser second.

No WordPress plugins. No drag-and-drop builders. No “quick fixes” that break six months later.

Just clean code, scalable architecture, and digital products that actually work.

## Collaboration Approach

**What we take on:**

- Full-stack web applications with real business logic
- Shopify theme development and performance optimization
- Real-time collaboration systems and APIs
- Performance auditing and technical consulting

**What we don’t:**

- WordPress sites or plugin customization
- Simple landing pages without backend requirements
- Projects where “fast and cheap” matters more than “right and scalable”

**How we work:**

- Direct communication, minimal meetings
- Code reviews and shared standards
- Performance budgets and measurable outcomes
- Long-term partnerships over one-off projects
