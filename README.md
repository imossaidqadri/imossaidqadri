## Philosophy & Approach

We ship systems that scale, not just websites. Multi-tenant platforms that serve multiple clients independently, AI-powered legal assistants that understand local law, custom e-commerce optimization, international Shopify themes that convert and pass Core Web Vitals, property platforms that automate lead management.

**We take on:**

- Full-stack applications with complex business logic
- AI integration with real-time capabilities
- Shopify optimization and custom themes
- Real-time systems and performance consulting

**We don’t:**

- WordPress or plugin customization
- Simple landing pages without backend needs
- “Fast and cheap” over “right and scalable”

No drag-and-drop builders. No quick fixes that break later. Just clean code and systems that work.
