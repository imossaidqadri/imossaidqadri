## Philosophy & Approach

We ship systems that scale, not just websites. Real-time collaboration that syncs across devices, e-commerce that converts international traffic, property platforms that automate lead management.

**We take on:**

- Full-stack applications with business logic
- Shopify optimization and custom themes
- Real-time systems and performance consulting

**We don’t:**

- WordPress or plugin customization
- Simple landing pages without backend needs
- “Fast and cheap” over “right and scalable”

No drag-and-drop builders. No quick fixes that break later. Just clean code and systems that work.
